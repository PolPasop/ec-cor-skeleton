    <p>Normally chaired by CoR's President, the main purpose of the plenary sessions is to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Vote opinions, reports and resolutions</li>
      <li>Adopt CoR's political programme at the beginning of every term</li>
      <li>Elect President, First Vice-president and remaining members of the Bureau</li>
      <li>Set up policy commissions within the institution</li>
      <li>Approve CoR draft estimates of expenditure and revenue</li>
      <li>Revise and agree on CoR Rules of Procedure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The relevant CoR commission will appoint one of its members – known as the rapporteur – to draft an opinion on the legislative proposal which is then voted during one of CoR plenaries. If it gets a majority vote it is adopted and handed in to the other EU institutions.</p>

    <p>The CoR may also proactively adopt a position on a particular issue through an own-initiative opinion.</p>
